# Fashion-MNIST

Demonstration of training and developing CNNs to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset using Pytorch.

Demonstration and code provided as a [single notebook.](Fashion_MNIST_Rane.ipynb)



### Task Description:

[Fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a small dataset for fashion product classification consisting 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. 
Here I demonstrate how you can train your own CNN network(s) which reach(es) similar accuracy (~95) as the [benchmarks](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#benchmark) and yet still “efficiently” (e.g. without millions of parameters). I also show the process of developing a Deep learning architecture and tuning its hyperparameters by testing at least 3 model variations using different strategies, e.g. network structures, data augmentations, regularizations, etc.
